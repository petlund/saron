# Saron
Saron is a small application for churches to handle the contacts with their members and data on baptism and membership. 
The application builds on jtable (jtable.org) and a PHP-service layer in front of a postgress database.

# Installation
## Database
- Use an existing database or set up a new MySql-Server instance.
- Use the 'databasestructure.sql' (database - dir ) to create and set up the database 
-- The user is a localhost-user. Maybee you have to change that...? 
- The script create the database 'saron', tables, index and an application user 'saron'
- The script add an 'admin' user account.  

## Apache
- Set up an Apache server
- Maybe set 'AddDefaultCharset utf-8' in httpd.conf 
- Think about the need of SSL and HTTPS

## Wordpress
- Install wordpress
- Install the plugin: https://sv.wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/
- add two user roles: 'saron_edit' and 'saron_view'. 
- Bugfix wordpress_ Change wordpress/wp-includes/pluggable.php row 2130 to 'if ( strlen($hash) !== 0 && strlen($hash) <= 32 ) {' to avoid error messages when username isnÂ´t in the database. 
- Easy timer editor: 
- Set session time out to one hour. Saron-gui has a 30 minutes time out 

## Application
- Saron must be installed direct under web_root/wordpress/
- Rename config_template.php to config.php. Update config.php with the database connection information
- Add path to (TCPDF, /wordpress/wp-load.php)
- Session time i set to 30 min (1800000 ms) in /wordpress/saron/saron/util/util.js. In the future this property should be moved to a better place...
